# Snake_game_using_Pyglet

Tried to learn and make something new, ended up making a snake game from scratch. Used only online documentations available, as not many videos are available for this
package.Got frusatrated, cried a little bit maybe, but after few days finally completed this mini project of user playable, snake game, which consists all features, 
of a normal snake game. Hope you like it cause i like it very much, as I learnt from it a lot.
